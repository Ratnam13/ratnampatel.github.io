    <h1>Hydraulic Vane Pump Optimization</h1>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> CATIA V5, ANSYS Mechanical/Fluent, FreeFEM++, MATLAB</p>
    <p>
      In my graduate research at Purdue’s Maha Fluid Power Research Center, I designed and optimized
      dual-lip vane pump components under high-pressure operating conditions. Using DOE-driven optimization,
      I achieved up to <strong>25.7% reduction in flow ripple</strong> and <strong>8% improvement in volumetric efficiency</strong>
      compared to the industry reference cam-ring profile.

      I also developed and operated hydraulic test rigs with instrumentation and data acquisition,
      validating simulation predictions with experimental data. This gave me hands-on exposure to both
      failure diagnostics and manufacturability assessments.
