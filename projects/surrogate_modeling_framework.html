        <h1>Surrogate Modeling and Optimization Framework</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          A three-stage framework covering design of experiments, surrogate model construction,
          and surrogate-assisted optimization. Implemented and validated in Python (NumPy,
          SciPy, SMT, and Pymoo) to illustrate the transition from sampling to adaptive design decisions.

        <h2>Overview &amp; Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Surrogate modeling offers a tractable alternative to direct high-fidelity simulation.
          The framework developed here demonstrates sampling strategies, model building
          and validation, and ultimately surrogate-based optimization—key elements for
          reducing computational cost in complex engineering design (e.g., hydraulic-pump geometry optimization or airfoil redesign).

        <h2>A. Sampling &amp; Design of Experiments</h2>
        <p>
          Implemented and compared multiple sampling schemes:
          <strong>Full Factorial, Latin Hypercube Sampling, Halton,</strong> and <strong>Sobol Sequences</strong>.
          Uniformity was evaluated via φ<sub>p</sub>-discrepancy and visual scatter for 1-D/2-D test functions.
          Low-discrepancy sequences consistently improved coverage for a fixed budget.

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>B. Surrogate Model Construction &amp; Validation</h2>
        <p>
          Built surrogate models for analytical benchmarks (Currin, Branin, Himmelblau) using:
          <strong>Kriging (Gaussian process regression)</strong>,
          <strong>Radial Basis Functions (RBF)</strong>, and
          <strong>Polynomial Response Surfaces (PRS)</strong>.
          Hyperparameters were tuned via maximum likelihood; models were compared via LOOCV error, R², and residual plots.
        </p>
        <ul class="meta">
          <li>LOOCV error reduced by &gt; 90% vs PRS when switching to Kriging on smooth functions.</li>
          <li>RBF with cubic kernels remained robust on sparse, irregular designs.</li>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>C. Surrogate-Based Optimization &amp; Adaptive Sampling</h2>
        <p>
          The optimization stage integrates acquisition functions—
          <strong>Expected Improvement (EI)</strong> and <strong>Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)</strong>—
          to guide adaptive infill. In the airfoil case, surrogates approximate CFD-derived drag responses
          and drive a design loop that balances exploration and exploitation.

        <p>
          Overall, adaptive infill reduced true evaluations by roughly 70% relative to uniform sampling,
          while the robust design step traded a small increase in mean \(C_d\) for a significant reduction
          in variance—valuable for reliability-minded applications.
